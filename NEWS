Changes in version 1.4.0

	o New idea of probability calculation for space defined by CDF
	  and copula survival function. Its use accelerated the calculation
	  of this probability. At the same time, it recently allowed us
	  to carry out this calculation even for a copula dimension greater
	  than 2. Not for 'amh' and 'fgm' copulas.

	o New functions have been inserted, namely:
	  'gentruk', 'kopula', 'prosim', 'trimeze', 'vfenuo'.

	o The following functions have been deleted as unnecessary:
	  'CSmeze', 'CSmezesi', 'vfmargi', 'vfpint', 'vfplot', 'vfprip',
	  'vfpsae', 'vfpsimsi', 'vfeduo', 'fxa'.

Changes in Version 1.3.0

	o Canceling the 'gaussian' copula option.

	o Fix the end of 'vfex'. Now you can not 'joe' as 'gaussian'.

	o A check has been added to the functions c('vfclayton',
	  'vffrank', 'vfgumbel', 'vfjoe', 'vfalihaq') whether '0 <= u <= 1'.

	o Added three functions: 'CSmezesi', 'vfpsimsi', 'vfpsae'.

Changes in Version 1.2.0

	o The name copula 'alihaq' has been changed to 'amh' as shown
	  in the 'copula' package.

	o Added four functions: 'fxa', 'prunikus', 'CSmeze', 'vfpint'.
	  Their use is demonstrated in the examples in the help for 'CSmeze'.

	o 'Vfpripo': Originally was only the first component of the vector
	  'pro' smaller than 1. Now, there may be more, but just behind
	  a 'pro[i + 1] < pro[i]', i = 1, ... , k.

  o In NAMESPACE, the missing 'vfex' is added.

  o Added distributions 'BetaPrime' and 'Beta'.

  o Added 'vfeduo' to compute expected values of marginals.

  o Added option 'ped' into 'vfploto' to applicate 'vfeduo'.

Changes in Version 1.1.0

  o Fixed 'vfalihaq'.

  o Examples have been added to help for 'vfalihaq', 'vfjoe' and 'vffgm'.

  o Next to 'vfplot' is newly 'vfploto'.

  o Instead of the 'vfprip' are 'vfpripo' or 'vfprifo' with vector
    parameter 'pro' as a substitute for 'hom' and 'jm'.

  o Duo 'vfmrg' and 'vfex' replace 'vfmargi'.

  o 'vfploto' uses 'vfpripo' or 'vfprfo' and 'vfmrg' and 'vfex'
    as well.

  o Original functions remained in the package.
