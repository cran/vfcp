Changes in Version 1.2.0

	o The name copula 'alihaq' has been changed to 'amh' as shown
	  in the 'copula' package.

	o Added four functions: 'fxa', 'prunikus', 'CSmeze', 'vfpint'.
	  Their use is demonstrated in the examples in the help for 'CSmeze'.

	o 'Vfpripo': Originally was only the first component of the vector
	  'pro' smaller than 1. Now, there may be more, but just behind
	  a 'pro[i + 1] < pro[i]', i = 1, ... , k.

  o In NAMESPACE, the missing 'vfex' is added.

  o Added distributions 'BetaPrime' and 'Beta'.

  o Added 'vfeduo' to compute expected values of marginals.

  o Added option 'ped' into 'vfploto' to applicate 'vfeduo'.

  o Fixed 'vfalihaq'.

  o Examples have been added to help for 'vfalihaq', 'vfjoe' and 'vffgm'.

  o Instead of the 'vfprip' are 'vfpripo' or 'vfprifo' with vector
    parameter 'pro' as a substitute for 'hom' and 'jm'.

  o Duo 'vfmrg' and 'vfex' replace 'vfmargi'.

    as well.

  o Original functions remained in the package.
